<h2> Dancing </h2>
<p> Dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. This movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture.[nb 1] Dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.

An important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance,[4] although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. Other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronized swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.</p>


<h2> How it feels like... </h2>
<blockquote>

<p> "I love dancing because it makes me feel on top of the world. With dance I can express all of my emotions. I connect with myself, the people around me, the people watching me, and God.</p>

 <p> My spirit comes to life when I dance. My soul is soothed. I release energy.</p>

 <p> I can express my personality and who I am in ways words limit me.</p>

<p>  show the world I am strong when I dance. I feel strong when I dance.</p>

(...)

<p> It is the world’s biggest secret. It is the intelligence overlooked in many disciplines.</p>

<p>  Dance is a way to the Divine."</p>
